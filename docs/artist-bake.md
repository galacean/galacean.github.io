Taking the bake of the C4D-OC renderer under the Windows platform as an example.

### Introduction

Baking is to expressed all rendered material colors information in the form of a texture.

Baking first requires two sets of models: a high model, a low model. High model is used to bake finer texture, and the low model is used to ensure the unity of the UV when using the texture after entering the engine, So first generate the low poly model, arrange the uv, and then perform the detailed processing to produce the high model, high model can be made more detailed to baking more detachment texture.

The left side is the low model, and the right side is the high model. As can be seen from the lines, the high model details will be more.

The details of the random wiring are different, but the visible parts of the two must be consistent, and the covered part is not considered, so the high model must be generated by the low model to ensure the consistency of uv.

### Specific baking process

1. Use the C4D adjustment material to render the prepared high model to the desired effect. The texture used on the face also needs to be drawn in accordance with the overall uv layout. After adjusting the material, it is ready for baking.

2.  The important point of baking is to select the camera mode, specify the label of the camera that needs to be output, and add the unique camera label of the OC renderer.

3. Click the added camera label to enter the label properties, there will be many options for the camera type, one of which is baking, select baking.

4. Set the baking group ID to a number other than 1 in the baking menu, here it is 2.

5. Then you need to group the models that need to be baked into a group, as shown in the figure below, group all the required models into a group and add the OC object label.

6. Click on the label to display the label properties to select the object layer, and then set the baking ID inside to the same value as the baking group ID, here is 2, and then click Render, the desired picture can be baked.

If you are not very satisfied with the baking results, C4D and Substance Painter can both paint and modify the texture. Realistic rendering is not the only choice. Painting textures can also be used to restore some special styles.
